The back-breaking sway of the Empire takes a long time and so does the suppression of non-human species. Much too long is the terror regime under the leadership of Emperor Palpatine in power and holds the whole galaxy in their stranglehold.<br /><br />But now resistance is arising. Scattered to many worlds humans and non-humans begin to form an alliance. Together they arm theirselves to release the galaxy from the burden of imperial governance. Brave men like Han Solo or Luke Skywalker and strong-willed women like Leia Organa or Mon Mothma lead the first battles and established the Rebel Alliance.<br /><br />The first Death Star war destroyed but still there are huge imperial fleets crossing the galaxy and bringing death and perdition to countless worlds. Soon the Alliance will break these forces up and restore peace and justice throughout the galaxy.
