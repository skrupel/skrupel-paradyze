For hundreds of years the Old Republic prospered and stretched out more and more without noticing the problems resulting from this expansion. The Jedi, so-called keepers of peace throughout the galaxy, also did not help the Republic in this phase of increasing problems.<br />Finally it was due to one single man, that he recognized all the mischiefs and began to do something against it. Senator Palpatine, Senator of the system Naboo, began to develop a truly ingenious plan and to implement it over dozens of years. Over execution of this plan he was appointed Supreme Chancellor of the senate of the Republic before he suspended the senate with a stroke of genius and appointed himself emperor of the new Empire.<br />Supported by loyal and strong companions like Darth Vader and Grandmoff Tarkin as well as the intimidating power of the Imperial Fleet Palpatine managed to hunt down the Jedi and to elaborate the galaxy spanning Empire. He recognized that the rights of the many non-human alien races was one of the basic sources for all evil throughout the galaxy, so that he largely excluded them from imperial life.<br /><br />Only few dare to resist the imperial order - and it will not take long and these doubters and troublemakers will be convinced or destroyed, too.
