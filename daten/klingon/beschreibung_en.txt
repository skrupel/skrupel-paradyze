Klingons are feared warriors. Their only way of life is battle. A fight one against the other is what makes a Klingons heart beat faster. Klingons are tough, very strong and able to withstand a lot of damage, as all vital organs exist in pairs. From childhood on they train for battle and anyone old enough to wield a sword is considered an adult. The Klingon Tribes and Clans are united under the High Council with its High Chancellor. His main task is to keep the Clans from annihilating each other and unite them in wartime. Klingon ships are built for only one purpose - war! A Klingon ship is fit for war or it isn't a Klingon ship! The Klingons are fanatical warriors, so a Klingon commander is never going to hesitate to overload his weapon systems to kill his enemy, even if that means risking death for the whole crew.
